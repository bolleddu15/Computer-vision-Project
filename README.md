## Algorithms 
**Image Processing Algorithms :**  Edge Detection like e.g., Sobel, Canny and Image Segmentation (e.g., Watershed, GrabCut) and Thresholding (e.g., Otsu's method)  
**Feature Detection and Matching :**  SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) , SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features), ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) and Harris Corner Detection. 
**Object Detection and Recognition : ** Viola-Jones Algorithm , SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) and YOLO (You Only Look Once)
**Image Classification and Segmentation :** R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks) --> R-CNN,Mask R-CNN,U-net CNN and Gans. 
**Optical Flow and Motion Estimation :** ImageNet Pre-trained Models (e.g., VGG, ResNet, Inception) and DeepLab, FCNs
**Image Enhancement and Restoration : ** Super-Resolution (SR) and Denoising Algorithms, Image Inpainting for Enhancement. 
**Transformations and Geometric Manipulations :** Homography Estimation and Affine and Perspective Transformations
